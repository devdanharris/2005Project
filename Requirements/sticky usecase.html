<h1>User Story</h1>

As a moderator, I've noticed the same questions get posted very frequently. I need to be able to make frequently asked questions easily findable, as well as remove duplicate posts.

<h1>Use Case</h1>

<h1>Title:</h1>
<p>Sticky Posts with High-Demand Information</p>


<h1>Primary Actor:</h1>
<p>Moderator</p>

<h1>Scope: </h1>
<p>Moderators and users of the SUD</p>

<h1>Stakeholders and Interests:</h1>
	<p>
		<ol>Moderator - Wants to avoid having multiple posts on the same topic</ol>
		<ol>Users	- Want to be able to quickly find important information without searching through posts</ol>
</p>

<h1>Precondition:</h1>
	<p>Moderator is logged in and has a post to sticky</p>

<h1>Minimal Guarantee:</h1>
	<p>A stickied post appears at the top of the post order</p>

<h1>Success Guarantee:</h1>
	<p>The post is marked as a sticky, appears as visually distinct, and shows up at the top of the list of posts for users</p>

<h1>Main Success Scenario:</h1>
<p>
	<ol>1)	Moderator finds a post to sticky</ol>
	<ol>2)	Moderator selects "sticky" from the moderator options provided</ol>
	<ol>3)	The list of posts is re-ordered with the sticky post staying at the top</ol>
	<ol>4)	Users see the sticky in a visually distinct manner at the top of the post order when they refresh</ol>
	</p>

<h1>Extensions:</h1>

<p><ol>a)	User is not a moderator:</ol>
	<ol><ol>a1) Non-moderators will not be shown the option to sticky posts</ol></ol>
	<ol>b)	The user deletes their stickied post:</ol>
	<ol><ol>b1) The stickied post will be removed as normal, and the reserved spot at the top of the post order will be released.</ol></ol>
	<ol>c)	Multiple posts are marked as sticky:</ol>
	<ol><ol>c1) The n stickied posts will reserve the top n spots in the post order, sorted from most to least recently stickied.</ol></ol>
	</p>
